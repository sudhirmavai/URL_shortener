# URL Shortener Web Application (Basic)
What will our Web app do (Objectives)?
1. As the name suggests, it shortens URLs.
2. Users can also save URLS by coming to the web app.
Why do we need a URL Shortener?
Sometimes we need to share or send links and this can be tiresome and 
annoying to copy and paste long URLs. That is where URL shorteners 
come in. Not only it helps in shortening the URL but it also allows the 
user to copy the shortened URL with a click of a button.
The project consists of 2 parts:
1. Frontend (done with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap)
2. Backend - Flask (Python)
3. Backend - Database ORM
Front-End Information
The front end consists of 2 web pages:
1. Home Page - A page will be shown where the user can enter the URL 
he/she wants to shorten. After the ‘shorten’ button is clicked, the 
shortened URL is displayed in the text field which the user can copy 
using the copy button.
2. History Page - Containing all the Original URLs along with the 
Shortened URL
